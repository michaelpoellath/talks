### What inspired this?

Check out the Go-Talk from Björn Rabenstein:

---
### Problem Statement

1. We want to increase a gobal value by a positiv amount.
2. It needs to be goroutine safe.

### How to Benchmark

go test -bench=Counter -cpu=1,4,16 #-race

---
### Results Naive

---
### What is bad about this ?

1. It is not go routine safe.


---
### Lets try mutex

---
### Results Mutex

### Why is it so much slower?

Lock contention!

---
### Maybe channels?
Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating. (R. Pike)

---?code=talk1/sample/go_channel/bench.go&lang=golang&title=Channel benchmark

---
### Results Channel

---
### This is expensive!
1. We do not lock - good.
2. CPU overhead - bad.

---
### Atomic
1. No locking through the dev.
3. Not many operations supported.
https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/

---?code=talk1/sample/atomic/bench.go&lang=golang&title=Atomic benchmark

### Results Atomic

### This is good!
1. ~ 45 times faster than channels.
2. ~ 9 times faster than locking.
3. ~ 3 times slower than the naive approach. :D

---
### Learnings
1. Solution is depending on your use-case.
2. Benchmarking is key to achieve good performance.
3. Go channels are not a Swiss army knife.

### Thank you!
