### What inspired this?

Check out the Go-Talk from Bjorn Rabenstein:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V7eJ0jN8-E

---
### Problem Statement

1. We want to increase a gobal value by a positiv amount.
2. It needs to be goroutine safe.

---?code=talk1/sample/naive/bench.go&lang=golang&title=Benchmark

--- 
### How to Benchmark

go test -bench=Counter -cpu=1,4,16 #-race

---
### Results Naive

---
### What is bad about this ?

1. It is not go routine safe.


---
### Lets try mutex

---?code=talk1/sample/go_routine_mutex/bench.go&lang=golang&title=Mutex benchmark

---
### Results Mutex

---
### Why is it so much slower?

Lock contention!

---
### Maybe channels?

---?code=talk1/sample/go_channel/go_channel.go&lang=golang&title=Channel implemenation
---?code=talk1/sample/go_channel/bench.go&lang=golang&title=Channel benchmark

---
### Results Channel

---
### This is expensive!
1. We do not lock - good
2. CPU overhead - bad 

---
### Atomic
1. No locking
2. Not many operations supported
https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/


---?code=talk1/sample/atomic/atomic.go&lang=golang&title=Atomic implemenation
---?code=talk1/sample/atomic/bench.go&lang=golang&title=Atomic benchmark

---
### Results Atomic

---
### This is good!
~ 45 times faster than channels
~ 9 times faster than locking
~ 3 times slower than the naive approach :D

---
### Learnings
1. Solution is depending on your use-case.
2. Benchmark at some point.

### Thank you!
